## 2. What are you most satisfied with?

The simplicity of the coding language compared to matlab and c/c++


## 3. What are you least satisfied with?

Not being able to apply our programs or apps to devices in the field. So being able to upload our shopping list app
to a mobile.


## 4. What worked well in your development process?

Learning to write code on paper without using a computer.


## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?

Reading and understanding the task sheet better.


## 6. Describe what resources you used and how you used them.

Lecture notes for using different functions and methods, practicals/examples to construct the kivy file and the doc
strings in the help files.


## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.

Getting overwhelmed in how big the assignments were when first reading the task sheets. By breaking the project down
into smaller tasks and completing one thing at a time helped in solving problems and understanding the program better.
